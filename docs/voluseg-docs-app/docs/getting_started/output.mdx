---

This page describes the contents and purpose of output files and directories generated by the Voluseg pipeline.

---

### `parameters.json`

**Parameter dictionary**

* Loaded via:

  ```python
  parameters = voluseg.load_parameters('parameters.json')
  ```

* Required as input to individual pipeline steps.

---

### `mask_plots/`

**Directory of average volume plane images**

* Contains average brain volume planes with brain mask superimposed.
* Useful for visually assessing the accuracy of brain masks.

---

### `transforms/`

**Directory of affine transforms for individual volumes**

* Stores affine transformation matrices for aligning volumes.
* Can be used to:

  * Quantify movement across time.
  * Register volumes from concurrent or different recordings.

---

### `volume0.hdf5`

**Metadata and statistics for the registered brain volume**

* `background`: Estimated background fluorescence.
* `block_valids`: Indices of blocks used for segmentation.
* `block_xyz0` / `block_xyz1`: Minimum and maximum XYZ coordinates of each block.
* `n_blocks`: Total number of blocks.
* `n_voxels_cells`: Approximate number of voxels per segmented cell.
* `thr_intensity`: Intensity threshold for the brain mask.
* `thr_probability`: Probability threshold for the brain mask.
* `volume_mean`: Mean intensity of the volume.
* `volume_mask`: Brain mask array.
* `volume_peak`: Local peak intensity values.

---

### `mean_timeseries.hdf5`

**Volume-mean fluorescence over time**

* `mean_baseline`: Detrended baseline of volume-mean fluorescence.
* `mean_timeseries`: Detrended volume-mean fluorescence time series.
* `mean_timeseries_raw`: Raw (unprocessed) volume-mean fluorescence time series.
* `timepoints`: Indices of timepoints used for cell segmentation.

---

### `cells0_clean.hdf5`

**Extracted cell data from segmentation and denoising steps**

* `background`: Estimated background fluorescence.
* `cell_baseline`: Computed baselines for each cell.
* `cell_timeseries`: Detrended (and optionally filtered) fluorescence signals per cell.
* `cell_timeseries_raw`: Raw cell timeseries directly from segmentation.
* `cell_weights`: Spatial footprints of cells (NMF spatial components).
* `cell_x`, `cell_y`, `cell_z`: XYZ coordinates of each cell.
* `n`: Total number of segmented cells.
* `t`: Number of timepoints.
* `volume_id`: Index mapping cells to volume regions.
* `volume_weight`: Spatial footprint weights per cell in the volume.
* `x`, `y`, `z`: Dimensions of the volume array.
